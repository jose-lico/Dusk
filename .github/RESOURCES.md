# Resources

Building this project has been quite the journey. I could never have made it this far without all the resources out there pointing me in the right direction and providing motivation along the way.<br>

In order to remain as wary and absorb as much information as possible, I try to look at lots of different sources, always cross checking information and making sure to follow it up with the comments on the video or article. I find this last aspect very important, as it can  lead me to new directions and prevent common gotchas.<br>

Interacting, discussing and learning from other devs has also been part of my learning experience, and has helped me push my knowledge and this project even further.

Among all the resources I used, there is one that stands out.<br> 
[The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) is a youtuber who has been developing his own engine called Hazel, recording tutorials and dev-logs of the process. He also has a lot of other videos on topics such as C++, game engines, rendering, and more.<br> 
Dusk's early development was very inspired by Hazel as I was still riding this bicycle with training wheels, but has since grown a lot, both in terms of implementation and goals.

There are hundreds of articles, blogs and videos that are not mentioned above but are greatly appreciated. Hopefully more will be added in the future for a more comprehensible list of usefull resources for game engine dev.
