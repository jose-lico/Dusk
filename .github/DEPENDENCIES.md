## Dependencies

Building a game engine is a massive task, and although I am trying to learn as much as possible about every nook and crany, sometimes shortcuts 
must be taken so I can maximize my time, effort and focus. Therefore I am resorting to popular libraries for certain functionality.<br> 
Some of these libraries will be swapped out in the future for a custom solution, once I feel like its time/the engine is a bit more mature.
